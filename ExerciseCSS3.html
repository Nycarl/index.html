            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/system" target="_blank">computer systems</a> capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence. <br>
                AI aids in processing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns, and making decisions based on the collected information. <br>
                Techniques such as Machine Learning, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/natural-language-processing-overview/" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing</a>, Computer Vision, and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/robotics">Robotics</a> are employed in AI. <br>
                AI encompasses abilities like learning, reasoning, perception, problem-solving, data analysis, and language comprehension. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, the amount of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2218042120" target="_blank">data</a> in the world is so humongous that humans fall short of absorbing, interpreting, and making decisions of the entire data. <br>
                This complex decision-making requires higher cognitive skills than human beings. This is why we’re trying to build machines better than us, in these task. <br>
                Another major characteristic that AI machines possess but we don’t is repetitive learning. Let consider an example of how Artificial Intelligence is important to us.
            </p>


            <p>
                Data that is fed into the machines could be real-life incidents. How people interact, behave and react ? etc. <br>
                So, in other words, machines learn to think like humans, by observing and learning from humans. That’s precisely what is called <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-machine-learning/" target="_blank">Machine</a> Learning which is a subfield of AI. <br>
                Humans are observed to find repetitive tasks highly boring. Accuracy is another factor in which we humans lack. Machines have extremely high accuracy in the tasks that they perform. <br>
                Machines can also take risks instead of human beings.
            </p>


            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) mimics human-like intelligence to perform tasks traditionally done by humans, using a combination of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ai-algorithms/" target="_blank">algorithms</a>, data, and computational power. <br>
                AI systems gather large amounts of data, clean and preprocess it, select suitable algorithms, and train models on labeled or unlabeled data. <br>
                They are evaluated using various metrics and, once meeting performance criteria, are deployed into real-world applications. <br>
                AI systems continuously learn and improve with new data, adapting through techniques like online, transfer, and reinforcement learning. <br>
                 During inference, AI models make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data.
            </p>


            <p>
                The future of AI is likely to involve continued advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/computer-vision" target="_blank">computer vision</a>,<br> which will enable AI systems to become increasingly capable and integrated into a wide range of applications and industries. <br>
                Some potential areas of growth for AI include healthcare, finance, transportation, and customer service. <br>
                Additionally, there may be increasing use of AI in more sensitive areas such as decision making in criminal justice, hiring and education, which will raise ethical and societal implications that need to be addressed. <br>
                It is also expected that there will be more research and development in areas such as explainable AI, trustworthy AI and AI safety to ensure that AI systems are transparent, reliable and safe to use. <br>
